# Validation of a Pediatric Bacterial Infection Classifier

This repository provides the data and code for a validation of a previously-developed Bacterial Infection classifier. The derivation is linked in the ./derivation subfolder, which links to the code in the [Pediatric BI 2020 repository](https://github.com/jmiahjones/pediatric-bi-2020).

The data sheet and codebook may be found inside the *Data for Validation Manuscript. 4.5.21.xlsx*
workbook.
