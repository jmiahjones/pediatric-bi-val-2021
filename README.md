# Validation of a Pediatric Bacterial Infection Classifier

This repository provides the data and code for a validation of a previously-developed Bacterial Infection classifier. The derivation is linked in the ./derivation subfolder, which links to the code in the [Pediatric BI 2020 repository](https://github.com/jmiahjones/pediatric-bi-2020).

Results are catalogued in the *results/* subfolder for the main and supplemental analyses with respect to inflammation: the main analysis results are present in *results/uti* while the markers using only leukocyte esterase are present in *results/leukesterase*. Under each of these folders, we additionally look at the overall bacterial infection outcomes in the *bi* subfolders as well as a sensitivity analysis restricted to the invasive bacterial infection outcomes in the *ibi* subfolders.
